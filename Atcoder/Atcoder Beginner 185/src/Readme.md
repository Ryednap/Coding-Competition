**Review**

This contest a lot easier I quickly solved A, B, C, D
However i had like an hour for solving E and F. I saw
a lot of submissions on F and then saw a copied segment
tree problem. However, I got busy in that  shit 
problem that-much that I missed even reading an easier
Dp problem on E. Atcoder needs to stop copy-to-be problems.

Still, F is unsolved because i will first study it.

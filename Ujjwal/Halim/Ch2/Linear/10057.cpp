// The idea is that the median is the answer

/*
 * Proof : Let median be x, and let's assume that it's not answer, then either the answer is x' > x or x' < x , 
 * for x' > x , let's say x' = x + 1. Now F(x) = |a1 - x| + |a2 - x| + |a3 - x| ... , if we see then let p numbers be less than x and q be greater
 * then p + q + 1 = n. now if x' = x + 1. then in the left all the answers will increase by +1 and on right -1 in the sorted order. 
 * total increase = p - q + 1 (For the case of median p = q so from here we can say that for odd n [n / 2 - n / 2 + 1] = increase of 1
 * so odd has only one value satisfying] . but p > q as it's median + 1 so net increase > median's value . So inductively we can say for, x' > xthat it's waste, also
 * if we continue going to right eventually q will decrease and p will increase which will increase the net increase which is not min.
 * 
 * also same argument for x' < x it's q - p - 1 . Now one thing to note using this proof method is that if (single median then that's the answer) else (double medain
 * then all the integers (median , median + 1) bettween are possible candidate and same argument as above applies p = q , so net increase is = increase in x

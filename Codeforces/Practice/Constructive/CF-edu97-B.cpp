//You are given a string s of even length n. String s is binary, in other words, consists only of 0's and 1's.
//String s has exactly n2 zeroes and n2 ones (n is even).
//In one operation you can reverse any substring of s. A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string.
//What is the minimum number of operations you need to make string s alternating? A string is alternating if siâ‰ si+1 for all i. There are two types of alternating strings in general: 01010101... or 10101010...

// For each consecutive same character we require 1 operation but that operation must involve the sequence of some other character. So answer is number
// of consecutive/2 (ceil) . This is true becuase number of blocks of 0's and 1's are same and if not then we can always trade one block for the border 0's
// or 1's respectively.
